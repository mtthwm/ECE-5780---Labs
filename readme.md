# Lab 1 - GPIO

# Lab 2 - Interrupts

# Lab 3 - Timers

The goal of this lab was to learn how to use the timers on the STM32 discovery kit board. We had to use the PWM mode of the timer to set the brightness of one of the onboard LEDs

# Lab 4 - UART

The goal of this lab was to learn how to communicate between devices using the USART protocol. We developed a simple program which allows the user to turn on LEDs on the STM discovery board using commands with the format xy

x: 

    r, g, b, o for the LED color

y:

0=turn off

1=turn on

2=toggle
